## Background
> Gwen Stefani is a three-time GRAMMY-winning songwriter with an immense fan base; 18 million Instagram followers and 10 million on Facebook.
> Her most-played song, Hollaback Girl, has over 290 million views on YouTube. Beyond the music scene, her iconic figure extends to fashion and visual style,
> melding a mult-cultural punk-rock elements from her former band, No Doubt, with early 2000s pop culture and Harajuku-inspired alternative streetwear.
> Her current aesthetic has evolved toward country influences, inspired by her partner, country music icon Blake Shelton.


## Problem
> Gwen Stefani needed a website to celebrate the 25th anniversary of her solo debut and to showcase her discography and fashion influence.


## Process
> I approached the design challenge by focusing on Gwen’s evolving brand identity—specifically, the shift toward a softer, country-inspired aesthetic.
> Through research, including her recent album Bouquet, I identified recurring themes, including floral visuals and a natural color palette of browns, and creams.
> These choices created warmth and maturity, a contrast to the bold, edgy visuals of her early solo years.
> To reflect this balance, I designed a layout that felt clean and grounded while intentionally breaking visual norms,
> for example, oversized numbers and tilted images to honor her avant-garde spirit.


## Result
> The design identity reflects Gwen Stefani's versatility as the fusion of her edgy artistic sensibilities from earlier in her career with her current,
> more spiritually mature aesthetic while commemorating her evolution as a pop icon,
